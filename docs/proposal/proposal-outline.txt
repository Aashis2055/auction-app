Vehicle auction app

Rough outline on proposal

Introduction:
- a mobile application that will allows the user to sell and buy used vechicles
- will provides a platform for pople to auction and bid on vehicles
- will use price determination algorithim to determine the price of the vehicle

Problem Statement
- no platform for mentioned service 
- mobile app such as quick deal do not provide multiple payment method
- people have hard time deciding on the selling price 

Objectives :
- to provide a application for selling used vehicles
- to provide a platform to get the best money worth for the vehicles

Methodology:
4.1 Requirment Identification
a. Functional Requirment
	Admin/mod
	- will be able to login 
	- will be able to monitor transaction 
	- remove post or ban a user

	Users
	- will be able to login and register
	- will be able to  post vehicles for auction
	- will be able to  bid on vehicles
	- will be able to chat/comment on a post
b. Non FUnctional Requirments
	- The platform will be availabe for both android and ios users
	- will provide security 
	- will privide user friendly ui/inteface
	- will have social platform integration
	- will be provide reliable platform

4.2 Feasibility Study 
i. Technical Feasibility:
The proposed system can be developed and deployed with the existing hardware, software, and resources. The application will be sclable and and can be optimized
ii. Economic Feasibility:
The system that is being developed economic and can be devloped with the available economic resources. 

iii. Operational Feasibility:
The system will be easy to operate and maintain therefore the system is operational feasible.

iv. Schedule Feasibility:
The proposed system can be completed within the given timeline and is schedule feasible.

4.3 High level design 
-> System Flowchart

4.4 Methodology:
a. Implementation plan:
-The proposed system (Vehicle auctioning app) will be created using the water fall model since the project has pre defined requirments.
- first will be system design based on requirment (will involve coding)
- secound implementation will involve in unit/feature testing
- integration and testing ( all unit devloped will be tested as a whole, other testing such as penetration testing, QA)
- deployment of system

b. Implementation Tools:
- flutter for mobile app
- reactjs for admin panel
- nodejs and express for backend
- mongodb for database

c. High Level Architecture 
- developed using three tier technology

Gantt chart 

Expected Outcome 
- a user friendly and secure platform which provides the facility for user to sell and buy used vehicles
