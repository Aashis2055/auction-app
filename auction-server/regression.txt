1. Generte a list of potential variables: independents and dependent
2. Collect data on the variables
3. check the relationships between each independent variables an dependent variable using scatterplots and correlations
4. check the relationships among the independent variables using scatterplots and correlations
5. (optional) conduct simple linear regression for each independent variables and dependent variable pair
6. use the non-redundant independent variables in the analysis to find the best fitting model
7. use the best fitting model to make predictions about the dependent variable
